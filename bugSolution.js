```javascript
/*bugSolution.js*/
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md relative z-10">
  <!-- Content -->
</div>
```
Adding `relative` and `z-10` might resolve layering conflicts if the gradient is being hidden behind other elements.  Adjust `z-index` as needed.
